# odin-recipes

This will describe the current project and what skills have been
learned/demontrated in the process of creation. Also potential
self reflection.

This project implemented HTML knowledge and skills to create a basic recipe website.
Creating links to alternate web pages, implementing images, ordered and unordered lists 
were some of the skills demonstrated in this project. Using the terminal to add, commit, 
and push the project to GitHub was also implemented in this project. After completion, 
I personally realized how it is easier to commit often after specific changes are made. 
The second day working on this project I honestly forgot to add/commit my work until a 
large portion had been done and found it harder to describe the work being commited. I 
can also see how this could potentially be troublesome if a problem or bug were to arise
within the code if few commits have been made.
